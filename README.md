    Node JS is a Javascript Runtime.
    We can use node JS to run javascript outside of browser.
    Uses V8 javascript engine that run JS into the browser.
        Takes JS code and compiles to machine code
        V8 is written in C++
    To check the node version
        Command: node -v
    You can use it for more than just server side code.
        Eg. utility scripts, build tools, ...

        Used for real apps
        Predictable sequence of steps
    Use the REPL (type 'node' in cmd)
        Great playground
        Execute code as you write it
